# Integrations

Cronhub has built-in and third-party tool integrations that play nicely with your monitors. You can think of integrations as notification channels that you can use in your monitors to alert you when an event occurs on Cronhub. Currently, we support Slack, SMS and Webhooks integrations but more integrations will be added in the future. If you're thinking to build a new integration for Cronhub you can [reach out to me](mailto:tigran@cronhub.io).

## Slack
Adding a Slack integration is a straightforward process. In order to integrate Slack with your Cronhub account, you should follow these steps

1. Go to the "Settings" page and click on "Slack" link under the "Integrations" section on the left-sidebar.

2. When you're on the Slack integration page you will see "Add to Slack" button (see the screenshot below). Click on it.

3. "Add to Slack" button will redirect you to the slack auth page where you can choose the channel you want to get Cronhub alerts to (see the screenshot below).

After choosing the channel "Authorize" it and you will go back to Cronhub. Now you can see all your connected channels in the list. You can add as many channels as you like.
